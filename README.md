# Frontend Exercise

We are excited about your interest in joining Tenatek! Just like you, we are very passionate about good code. Please help us better assess your candidacy by completing this demo project. The instructions are as follows.

## Business Case

A movie theater needs a website to showcase their offering to their customers and allow them to book seats. This particular movie theater is a cinephile's dream: all tickets are free!

## Requirements

- The customer should be able to browse all movies from the front page. For each movie, they should be allowed to see available showtimes; for each showtime, they should see a map of the auditorium with available seats.
  - [This API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) should be used to get a list of movies.
  - Auditorium maps should be invariant.
  - Showtimes and seat occupancy should be randomized.
- The customer should be able to pick their seat on the map. Once they've chosen their seat, they should be able to download/print their ticket.

## Deliverables

Once you're done, send the following to [talent@tenatek.com](mailto:talent@tenatek.com):

- The GitHub URL of the fork of this repo with your code.
- The Google Drive URL of the recording of your work process.
- Paste this text in the email body: _Tengo conocimiento que el trabajo que entrego en el presente correo electrónico no será remunerado, y no me garantiza una oferta de empleo._

## Notes

- **Don't forget to record your screen while you work!** (Sound not needed.)
- For the purposes of this evaluation, functionality is more important than good UI.
- Show us your best! Implement whatever good practices you believe are appropriate.
- Remember, you may not ask Tenatek staff for any clarifications.

**Best of luck! We believe in you.**
